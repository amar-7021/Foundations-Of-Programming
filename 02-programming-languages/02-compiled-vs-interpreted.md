# Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

## Compiled Languages
Code is translated **before execution**.

### Process:
Source Code → Compiler → Machine Code → Run

### Examples:
- C
- C++
- Rust

---

## Interpreted Languages
Code is executed **line by line**.

### Process:
Source Code → Interpreter → Execute

### Examples:
- Python
- JavaScript

---

## Important Note
Many modern languages use **both** compilation and interpretation.
