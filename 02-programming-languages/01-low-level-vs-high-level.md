# Low-Level vs High-Level Languages

## Low-Level Languages
Close to hardware.

### Characteristics:
- Fast execution
- Manual memory control
- Hard to read

### Examples:
- Assembly - mnemonics (e.g., MOV, ADD)
- Machine Code - (binary instructions 0s and 1s)
- C - middle-level (or sometimes called low-level–ish)

##### Note:  Why C is considered close to low-level*

- You can directly work with memory (pointers)

- Minimal runtime / abstraction

- Often used for operating systems, drivers, embedded systems

- Compiles to very efficient machine code**

## High-Level Languages
Designed for humans.

### Characteristics:
- Easy to read
- Automatic memory handling
- More productive

### Examples:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Java

## Key Difference
Low-level = control  
High-level = productivity
