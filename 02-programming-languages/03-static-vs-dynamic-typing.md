# Static vs Dynamic Typing

This is about when errors are checked.

## Static Typing
- Variable types are checked **before runtime**.
- More strict
- Safer for large projects

Example Programming Languages: Java, C++, C#, Rust

## Benefits:
- Fewer runtime errors
- Better performance

### Example:
```text
int x = 10
````

## Dynamic Typing
- Variable types are checked **at runtime.**.
- More flexible
- Faster to start learning

Example Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript

## Benefits:
- Faster development
- More flexibility

### Example:
```text
x = 10
x = "hello"
````
