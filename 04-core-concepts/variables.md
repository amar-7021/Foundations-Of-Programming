# Variables

## Overview
A variable is a named storage location in memory used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution.

Variables allow programs to work with dynamic data instead of fixed values.

## Key Characteristics
- Have a name (identifier)
- Store a value
- Can change during execution (depending on the language)
- Have a scope (where they are accessible)

## Variable Declaration
Variables are typically declared by specifying:
- Variable name
- Data type (in some languages)
- Initial value (optional)

### Example
```python
age = 25
name = "Alice"
```

## Scope of Variables
- **Local variables:** Defined inside functions or blocks
- **Global variables:** Defined outside functions and accessible throughout the program

## Naming Rules
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Cannot use reserved keywords
- Should be descriptive and meaningful

## Advantages
- Improve code readability
- Enable reuse of values
- Make programs flexible

## Common Mistakes
- Using unclear variable names
- Forgetting to initialize variables
- Misusing variable scope
