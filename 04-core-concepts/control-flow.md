# Control Flow

## Overview
Control flow determines the order in which statements in a program are executed. It allows programs to make decisions and repeat actions.

## Types of Control Flow

### Conditional Statements
Used to execute code based on conditions.

```python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
```

## Loops
- Used to repeat a block of code.


```text
<!-- For Loop -->
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

```text
<!-- While Loop -->
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Control Statements
- **break:** Exit a loop
- **continue:** Skip current iteration
- **pass:** Do nothing (placeholder)

## Advantages
- Adds decision-making capability
- Reduces code repetition
- Makes programs dynamic and interactive

## Common Mistakes
- Infinite loops
- Incorrect conditions
- Poor loop control
